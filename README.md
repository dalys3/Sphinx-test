# Sphinx-test
Test repo for Sphinx and Read the Docs
For testing purposes, you will need to create a repository within your own public account and put the sources there in preparation for importing to Read The Docs. You won't be able to import from our dellemc-symphony location on GitHub (nor would you want to). Eventually, we will work with Desmond to figure a way to import from dellemc-symphony.
